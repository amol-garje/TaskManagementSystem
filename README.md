## Introduction
- Task management system is a demonstration web application developed for own project works where users can manage various tasks individualy.
- Developed on Spring Boot(backend) with Raect js (front-end) frameworks and MySql database.
- Project is focused primarily on handling document-based projects.
- “User” can be a member of single define Programs. And one program can have any number of User members associated with it.
- But The Member Adding Functinality is till In Process..
- The project is in an early stage of development and needs lots of work and bug fixing to make it usable in real life. Still, learners can use this as template and make it functinal application.
- I would be happy to see people contribute and enhance this project.
- I implemented various functionality in My task management system, such as login, registration, task creation, task updates, and more.
### TODO:
- Lots of UI/UX improvements.
